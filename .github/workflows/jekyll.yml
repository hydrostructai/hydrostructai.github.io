# This workflow is loosely based on the Jekyll official starter workflow:
# https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/pages/jekyll.yml
#
# It is designed to build and deploy a Jekyll site to GitHub Pages
#
# There are two separate jobs, one for building, one for deploying.
# The build job will run on all branches.
# The deploy job will only run on the main branch.
#
# To use this workflow, you must do two things:
#
# 1. Update the `main` branch setting in the `deploy` job to match the branch
#    you are using as your deployment branch.
#
# 2. Add the `JEKYLL_PAT` secret to your repository settings. This should be a
#    GitHub Personal Access Token with read/write permissions for the `contents`
#    scope.
#
# 3. Add the `CNAME` file to your repository if you are using a custom domain.
